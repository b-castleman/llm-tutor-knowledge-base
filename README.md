# Examining the Influence of Varied Levels of Domain Knowledge Base Inclusion in GPT-based Intelligent Tutors
## Conference Paper
The following is a repository for the code and data from Castleman and Turkcan (2023). The paper URL will be included below once it becomes available.

## Tutor Code
The code for the intelligent tutors is located in the directory `'./Tutor Architecture'`. The files found here are as listed:

-Tutor.py: The code for the intelligent tutor as described in Castleman and Turkcan (2023)
-runme.py: An example of how tutors can be instantiated and ran for the three different intelligent tutors of varying knowledge base access levels
-SupervisorFiles: A directory of files that make up the knowledge base. The educational supervisor may alter these if wished
 -topicsList.json: A list of all topics wished to be taught within this lesson subject. In Castleman and Turkcan (2023), we did not split our information into different topics. However, the functionality has been made available for users. This file is required nonetheless as an encoding for the name of the topic to the rest of its information
 -topicsInformationList.json: A list of descriptions for all topics wished to be taught for the lesson subject. This is essentially the partial knowledgebase access option and this alters the information presented to GPT.
 -lectureMaterial.json: A list of all topics' subtopics. This is essentially the full knowledgebase access option and this alters the information presented to GPT. As many subtopics as one wishes to use is available.
 -generatedKeywords.json: The keywords generated by GPT for the lectureMaterial.json subtopics. Though this is automatically created by GPT, we leave it in the SupervisorFiles directory as the supervisor may want to add, edit, or remove certain keywords. By default, the supervisor should leave this file alone.
 -lineToInformation.json: The Haystack encodings generated by GPT for the lectureMaterial.json and generatedKeywords.json files. Though this is automatically created by GPT, we leave it in the SupervisorFiles directory as the supervisor may want to add, edit, or remove the information presented to the user if Haystack chooses for it to be used. By default, the supervisor should leave this file alone.
